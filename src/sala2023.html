<h1>SALA 2023</h1>
<h3>"Chaos and Cosmos"</h3>
<p>
  I am very thrilled to be part of the South Australian Living Arists Festival. Mark your calendars for a visit to The Exeter in August, where our exhibition will take place from the 3rd to the 31st. Our exhibition will showcase the works of nine local artists, including Shani Engelbrecht, Charlotte Prior (of "Nipslip"), Hollis Souter, Olivia Bailetti, and Finn Murabito, where we answer the question, "what exactly is the the interplay between order and disorder?"
<p >
  The festivities kick off with an opening night on the 3rd, complete with nibbles and drinks. Free entry.
