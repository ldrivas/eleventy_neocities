  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hello, my name's Lucien and welcome to my website! 
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to hospitality, I have also worked as an NDIS Support Coordinator.
    This role allowed me to provide assistance and support to individuals with disabilities, helping them navigate the NDIS system
    and access the necessary services and resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my spare time, I like to read, play piano, learn to code, and gallavant around barhopping in the city with my friends. I've enjoyed running various arts events with my friends and working in the Adelaide Fringe, and am contributing in an upcoming SALA exhibition.
