<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello, my name's Lucien and welcome to my website!
    
<p>
  At the absolute centre of my interest lies a deep commitment to enriching community experiences, especially within the education sector.
</p>
<p>
  My professional journey includes pivotal roles in event coordination, where I've gained experience managing noteworthy projects such as "Tim’s Gardening" and "INCOMING_TRANSMISSION" for Gastarbeiter. These experiences have sharpened my skills in prioritising tasks, managing pressure, and ensuring successful events unfold professionally and on time.
</p>
<p>
  In 2023 so far, I have worked on projects in Adelaide Fringe, and am taking part in SALA with an upcoming exhibition at The Exeter Hotel.
</p>
<p>
  Here, you will discover my latest projects, learn more about my passion for events, and gain insights into how I aim to create vibrant and nurturing spaces for our lovely Adelaide community.
</p>
<p>
  In my free time, I like to get out to live music and events, play violin in Death of An Adelaidies Man (Adelaide’s primary Leonard Cohen cover band), draw, and enjoy reading up about education practice.
