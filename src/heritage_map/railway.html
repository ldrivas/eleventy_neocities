    The original station, a charming limestone structure, was established in 1856 and was the first Government-owned and steam-operated railway in the British Empire.</p>
<p>Today's station, famous for its beautiful Art Deco aesthetic, opened to the public in 1928 and serves over 12-million people per year!</p>
