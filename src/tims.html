<h1>Tim's Gardening @ ARCADIA</h1>
<p>
    Welcome to the mesmerising world of the ARCADIA Festival, where art, music, and community converge in a celebration of the historic Central Market Arcade. As an organiser of pop-up theatre restraurant "Tim's Gardening & Restaurant", I had the privilege of working with Gastarbeiter to join in the festival. Taking place on the evenings of Saturday, June 11th, and Sunday, June 12th, 2022, Tim's Gardening participated to breathe new life into the Arcade before its redevelopment. Working behind the scenes, my role involved managing the logistics, from budgeting to seamless communication with fellow festival organisers. I was also responsible for ensuring there are detailed runsheets, and the event description and all documentation in the communal Google Drive was in order (budgeting documents, planning documents, runsheets, checklists, etc), communicating with stakeholders, sourcing props, and providing assistance with social media outreach.

Filling the Arcade and vacant shops with musicians, visual and performance artists and craft makers, ARCADIA will turn the downcast vestiges of a bygone era into a mysterious, other-worldly cornucopia of ADL culture. A goodbye party not to be missed! Entry Cost Adult $15 - Free entry Saturday before 5pm. 
  With a line up that includes Kirin J Callinan, The Bait Fridge, Ollie English and many more, Arcadia is a unique weekend of music, art and performance."
