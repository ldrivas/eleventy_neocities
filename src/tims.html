  <h1>Tim's Gardening @ ARCADIA</h1>
  <p style="color: #333333;">
    Welcome to the mesmerising world of the ARCADIA Festival, where art, music, and culture converge in a celebration of the historic Central Market Arcade. As an organiser of this enchanting event, I had the privilege of coordinating the remarkable pop-up restaurant and show, "Tim's Restaurant." Taking place on the evenings of Saturday, June 11th, and Sunday, June 12th, 2022, our event breathed new life into the Arcade before its imminent redevelopment. Working diligently behind the scenes, my role involved managing the logistics, from registration and budgeting to seamless communication with fellow festival organisers. I was also responsible for crafting detailed runsheets, captivating event descriptions, and providing assistance with social media outreach.

Press release for ARCADIA: "ARCADIA is a two-day, music and arts festival celebrating and transforming the soon-to-be-redeveloped Central Market Arcade. Filling the Arcade and vacant shops with musicians, visual and performance artists and craft makers, ARCADIA will turn the downcast vestiges of a bygone era into a mysterious, other-worldly cornucopia of ADL culture. A goodbye party not to be missed! Entry Cost Adult $15 - Free entry Saturday before 5pm. 
  With a line up that includes Kirin J Callinan, The Bait Fridge, Ollie English and many more, Arcadia is a unique weekend of music, art and performance."

    As coordinator, I primarily helped keep things running on track, such as ensuring all documentation was saved in the communal Google Drive (budgeting documents, planning documents, runsheets, checklists, etc), communicating with stakeholders, purchasing props, and making sure everyone had their speeches rehearsed.
