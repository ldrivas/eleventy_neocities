<h1>Covid Marshall Party</h1>
<p>
  During the period leading up to the Fringe, we volunteers at ARTHUR Art Bar had the privilege of coordinating a Covid Marshall event.  The event occurred at ARTHUR on 15 March 2021. The event's purpose was for everyone to gain their Covid Marshall certificate in a fun and engaging way, and invited members of the public to join in. We had live music supplied by Dusty Fox Emoji, and by the end of the evening, all patrons had a lanyard and/or Covid vest and newly aquired certification.
